Personal info: My name is Auston Vance and I am a student at Southwest Tech. college at Cedar City UT. Currently I am 28 years old and have ADD. I love playing video games on my computer and I also love snowbording in the winter and wakeboarding in the summer. 
Why am I taking this program?: This is one of the career fields that has an ever growing need for work and I intent to capitalize on that by knowing and understanding this content enough to turn this into a career for myself. One of my end goals is to work on a triple A video game and have it actually be fun to play and know that I in some way made that happen.
